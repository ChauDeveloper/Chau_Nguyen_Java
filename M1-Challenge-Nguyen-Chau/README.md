# Module 1 Challenge - JAVA Bootcamp
### These projects display my understanding of object-oriented programming in Java by: <br />
- Demonstrate knowledge of polymorphism by coding alternate implementations using the same interface.
- Use composition as a code reuse mechanism, constructing one object from another.
- Implement JUnit test cases to unit-test functionality for each exercise.
